# Thesis

A link to SQL Runner where you can write SQL against your dataset:
https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=lookerdata&p=lookerdata&d=Fernanda_thesis&t=Videos&page=table

The scale of your dataset (How many tables? Roughly how many rows and columns?)
Three tables with roughly 16 , 4 and 5 columns respectively and around 500.000 rows.

The angle that you want to take with this project
Trending videos helps viewers see whatâ€™s happening on YouTube and in the world. Some trends are predictable, like a new song from a popular artist or a new movie trailer. Others are surprising, like a viral video. Trending aims to surface videos that a wide range of viewers will appreciate.
To achieve this, Trending considers many signals, including the number of views, the age of the video, the rate of growth in views, amongst others. However, there are many other signals that are considered to rank these videos. Analysing some videos that have been ranked in the past can provide more information on what determines if a video is ranked on Trending.
This project will attempt to analyse videos from 2018-2019 from different countries that have been displayed on the Youtube trending list, and figure out what other characteristics help to categorise a video as a trending.
3 high-level questions you want to answer
Which category has the largest number of trending videos?
How many views have the trending videos?
How is the behaviour of these videos in different countries?

How the 3 questions help with your angle
The questions above will help to analyse the signals that are taken into consideration to determine if a video is ranked on Trending. For example, understanding the most important categories that are grouping the trending videos or also, analyse if having a large number of views is required for a video to become trending.

Finally, comparing the videos in different countries will help to highlight the similarities and differences between different cultures. It will clarify if these signals are applied worldwide or if they are specific ones for each country.
